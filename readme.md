	VOLUMIO SPOTIFY CONNECT 2 PLUGIN

This new version use librespot.
If it works as expected, it will remplace volspotconnect


IMPORTANT

- Requires a Premium or Family account

To install
- You only need to download volspotconnect2.zip. Take care to download the "raw" file, not only html from github...
- From Volumio UI choose "plugins" in setting, then "upload plugin" and select the file you have downloaded
- First start may take several seconds, especially with armv6 because the chroot structure is built a this moment.
